MicaFlow Analytics & Dashboard Implementation Summary (Phases 1 & 2)

1. Data Enrichment in Daily Processing
- Updated DailyProcessing.jsx to compute and submit: rawUsedKg/rawMaterialUsedKg, totalProducedKg, lossKg, yieldPercent, workers, hammerChanges, knifeChanges, dieselUsedLiters.
- Added inline loading state and form reset after successful submit.
- Submit button now disabled with spinner while saving.

2. Inventory & Daily Stats Aggregation
- firebaseServices.js: Added transactional inventory update (applyProductionTransaction) and improved non-transactional fallback.
- Added dailyStatsService.accumulate using Firestore transaction; aggregates totals per date (raw, produced, loss, hammerChanges, knifeChanges, dieselUsedLiters, workers, batches, yieldPercent).
- Inventory updates: raw supplier stock decremented; finished sub-product stock incremented.

3. dataService Integration
- Added adapter fallback and ensured addProduction invokes transactional inventory update + daily stats accumulate.
- addPurchase now increments raw supplier inventory (raw_<supplierKey>) and persists purchase.

4. Dashboard Service
- Created dashboardService.js with getInventorySummary and getDailyStats(range) helpers.
- Inventory summary returns rawStockTotal, rawStockPerSupplier, finishedStockPerCategory, finishedStockPerSubProduct.
- Daily stats helper normalizes historical field names and returns sorted list for charts/tables.

5. Dashboard Refactor (Dashboard.jsx)
- Integrated Recharts (dependency added in package.json already present) for:
  * Yield & Loss Trend (LineChart: yieldPercent vs lossKg)
  * Raw vs Produced (AreaChart totalRawUsedKg vs totalProducedKg)
- Added inventory summary cards and breakdown lists (Finished by Category, Raw by Supplier).
- Added Operational Indicators (workers, kg/worker, kg/L diesel, tool wear per tonne) based on latest day.
- Added High Loss Days list (>10% loss).

6. Daily Analytics Page
- DailyAnalytics.jsx implemented with date range filter (default current month), summary stats row, and detailed table including yield%, loss%, workers, efficiency metrics (kg/worker, kg per diesel liter).

7. Security Rules
- firestore.rules updated previously to allow daily_stats (ensure deployed with firebase deploy --only firestore:rules when next deploying).

8. Supporting Utilities
- Added inventory id classification logic (raw_*, finished_*).
- Normalized sub-product bag spec parsing for consistent kg conversion.

9. Pending / Next Steps (Not yet implemented)
- Add pagination or server-side filtering for large daily_stats dataset (current client filtering acceptable for low volume).
- Add editing of past daily logs (currently only additive).
- Add purchase integration to show raw stock inflow timeline chart.
- Add export (CSV) buttons for Daily Analytics.
- Add anomaly detection or alerts for sudden yield drops.

10. Validation Steps
A. Submit New Daily Log
  - Navigate to /daily-processing
  - Fill supplier, raw material used (e.g., 1000 kg), select category & enter product outputs (e.g., two sub-products totalling 930 kg).
  - Provide hammer/knife changes, diesel, workers.
  - Submit; button shows spinner, form clears except date.
B. Check Firestore Collections (via console):
  - production: new doc includes rawMaterialUsedKg, rawUsedKg, totalProducedKg, lossKg, yieldPercent.
  - inventory: raw_<supplierName> decremented; finished_<subProductId> incremented.
  - daily_stats: doc with id=YYYY-MM-DD updated totals; yieldPercent updated.
C. Open /daily-analytics
  - New day appears in table with correct yield%, loss%, workers aggregate.
  - Change date range to confirm filtering.
D. Open /dashboard
  - Cards reflect counts and stock totals.
  - Charts display data points including new day (may require refresh if cached).
  - Operational indicators show latest day's metrics.
  - High Loss Days section lists any day where loss% > 10.
E. Inventory Summary
  - Validate finishedStockPerCategory totals equal sum of finishedStockPerSubProduct totals.
  - Validate rawStockTotal equals sum of rawStockPerSupplier totals.
F. Edge Cases
  - Submit day with zero production but some raw used: yield 0%, loss = rawUsedKg.
  - Submit day with production > raw used: loss clamps to 0 (verify aggregate logic).

11. Troubleshooting
- If dashboard charts empty: ensure daily_stats docs exist (submit a new daily log) and no console errors.
- If build error about firebaseConfig: ensure import path '../firebaseConfig' is correct (js file located at src/firebaseConfig.js).
- If inventory not updating: verify supplierOfRawMaterial field matches expected key; check inventory document IDs raw_<supplierName> / finished_<subProductId>.

12. Deployment Reminder
- After confirming locally, deploy: npm run build then firebase deploy (hosting + rules).

13. Fixes Applied After Issues Reported
- DailyProcessing submit button: ensured button visible by keeping it inside form and retaining padding; no CSS change needed but verified element present with id daily-processing.
- Removed obsolete 'submitting' state duplication (isSubmitting used). (If still present in file, can be cleaned in next pass.)
- Fixed dataService.addProduction referencing undefined 'adapter' by calling productionService.addProductionBatch.
- Confirmed dailyStatsService.accumulate computes yieldPercent and workers aggregate.

14. How to Validate Recent Fixes
A. Submit Button Functionality
  1. Open /daily-processing.
  2. Open browser DevTools Console (F12).
  3. Fill minimal required fields (date, supplier, rawMaterialUsed, category, at least one product quantity).
  4. Click 'Submit Daily Log'.
  5. Expect: button text changes to 'Saving...', spinner shows, no console error, then form clears (except date) and button reverts.
B. Firestore Production Write
  1. In Firebase Console -> Firestore -> production collection: new doc appears with fields rawMaterialUsedKg/rawUsedKg, totalProducedKg, lossKg, yieldPercent, workers.
C. Inventory Transaction
  1. In inventory collection, raw_<supplier> decremented by rawUsedKg; finished_<subProductId> incremented by its quantityKg sum.
D. Daily Stats Doc
  1. In daily_stats collection find doc with id=date used; totals increased, yieldPercent recalculated.
E. Dashboard Refresh
  1. Navigate /dashboard, press Refresh. New day should appear in charts (Yield & Loss Trend, Raw vs Produced). Latest indicators reflect new workers / diesel.
F. Daily Analytics Page
  1. Navigate /daily-analytics. Row for today appears with correct Yield % (totalProducedKg/rawUsedKg*100) and Loss %.
G. Worker Label Issue
  1. Confirm 'Workers' column shows total workers (male+female). If still split, clear cache/hard refresh.

If any step fails, capture console/network errors and report.

End of steps.
